*As a user* of the Comet Test System I want to have a data set that covers as many current test scenarios as possibleso that I can detect errors at an early stage and to have a far-reaching safety net*,"Acceptance criteria:** There are events that are in the future (best already on the start page: Objektforum Karlsruhe) for which a Contao import can be started.* There are events that have a duplicated ID in the Contao database to test corresponding warnings.* Analog for trainigs* In the Contao system all registration types are available for trainings (private customers, andrena, business customers)*Comment.The training backend made it necessary that training data is also available in the mocked Contao system. The previous test data generator did not cover this and its existence was unknown to the team. Therefore, a new MYSQL database was created with a manually generated database state.Previous procedure: There is a SQL file with anonymized data in the test setup project. If a new test case is needed, this test file has to be adapted and on the test system the MYSQL container has to be stopped, removed and then rebuilt and restarted."

"As a course manager I want to receive a meaningful error message when I try to delete a course that still has registrations or participants,so that I know what to do to actually delete the course.\\","Acceptance Criterion:* When I try to delete a course that still has enrollments, the error message ""Please remove all enrollments first to be able to delete the course.""* If I try to delete a course that still has participants, the error message appears: ""Please remove all participants first to be able to delete the course.""\\Notes:* So far, only the console logs HTTP error 409.* The explicit check of registrations and participants is necessary, since a registered contact has already become liable to pay (pay the cancellation fee), e.g. due to the expiry of a cancellation deadline."
"As an Event Manager I want to be able to also manually set for an event in the Details viewevery single step in the checklist that has not yet been set automatically by CoMETto one of the states* done manually* not necessary* open (initial state)\\and add a comment,so that especially online events, for which not all points of the checklist in CoMET can or must be run through,the event can be completed.\\","Acceptance Criteria:* For each manual adjustment, a corresponding entry including the associated comment appears in the event details view in the history.* Only checklist entries that have not yet been set automatically by CoMET can be edited manually.* Only manual checklist entries can be reset.\\Notes:* This feature is also particularly important for the TC, which is intended to be a 1:1 derivative of the EC in an initial MVP version 0.80.* The checklist is a common component, i.e. changes in the EC also affect the TC. This is also desired.\\Implementation Alternative:* Suspend the checklist check when an event is closed, i.e. an event can be set to closed at any time."
"As a Training Manager I want to add the course type private course to the TC,so that private courses can be managed in the TC in addition to public courses.and that CRM no longer needs to be used for courses, thereby saving potentially toxic contacts in CRM.\\","Acceptance Criteria:* In the TC, in the view Trainings, Training Overview, a new training of type private training can be created, in addition to the type public training, i.e. there is a selection box that allows the Training Manager to choose which type of training he needs.* Since private courses are not stored in Contao (the registration is done in-house by the customer, not via Contao), no Contao warning is generated for the course type private course (counterpart in Contao).* Under Registrations, the button 'Import from Contao' has been replaced by the button 'Import from Excel', which has been deactivated so far.* The billing for a private course is - in contrast to the public course - not done on contact level but on company level. This functionality will be mapped as a normal consulting order in CRM. Therefore, it must only be possible to manually set the billing document to completed in the checklist."

As an Event Manager I want to be able to change the location of an event (but not the event type) in the EC - in analogy to the TC - in the detail view of an event that has not yet been completedso that I am able to map a change of plan of the mostly long in advance planned events from e.g. Karlsruhe to Online.and thus to keep the statistics about the success of the events at the different locations correct and meaningful.\\,Acceptance criteria:# An event that has not yet been completed is selected.# It is edited in the detail view.# The location is changed from e.g. Karlsruhe to Online.# The change is saved.# Online is now shown as the location - both in the fields of the detailed view and in the title of the event.# All other fields of the event are unchanged.

"As an Event Manager I want to have a button ""import from Contao"" available in the EC for the event type LeanCoffeein the view Registrationssimilar to the other event types (e.g. OSC or ObjektForum),so that I can manually import the registrations for a Lean Coffee from Contao.\\Notice.* Please check if this requirement can be implemented generically right away with reasonable effort, so that when a new event type is created, the manual import from Contao is possible without programming effort.* Displaying the ""import from Contao"" button should be the default behavior.
